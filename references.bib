  abstract = {Aims:A tunable, high spectral resolution, high effective finesse, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) is designed for obtaining narrow-passband images, magnetograms, and Dopplergrams of the transition region emission line of CIV (155 nm). Methods: The integral part of the CIV narrow passband filter package (with a 2-10 pm FWHM) consists of a multiple etalon system composed of a tunable interferometer that provides high-spectral resolution and a static low-spectral resolution interferometer that allows a large effective free spectral range. The prefilter for the interferometers is provided by a set of four mirrors with dielectric high-reflective coatings. A tunable VUV piezoelectric-control interferometer has undergone testing using the surrogate F\{2\} eximer laser line at 157 nm for the CIV line. We present the results of these tests with a description of the overall concept for a complete narrow-band CIV spectral filter. The static interferometer of the filter will be built using a set of fixed MgF\{2\} plates. The four-mirror prefilter is designed to have dielectric multilayer $\Pi$-stacks employing the concept used in the Ultraviolet Imager of NASA's Polar Spacecraft. A 10-pm dual etalon system allows the effective free spectral range to be commensurate with the prefilter profile. With an additional etalon, a triple etalon system would allow a spectrographic resolution of 2 pm. The basic strategy has been to combine the expertise of spaceflight etalon manufacturing with VUV coating technology to build a VUV FPI which combines the best attributes of imagers and spectrographs into a single compact instrument. Results: High spectral-resolution spectro-polarimetry observations of the transition region CIV emission can be performed to increase our understanding of the magnetic forces, mass motion, evolution, and energy release within the solar atmosphere at the base of the corona where most of the magnetic field is approximately force-free. The 2D imaging of the full vector magnetic field at the height of maximum magnetic influence (minimum plasma beta) can be accomplished, albeit difficult, by
measuring the Zeeman splitting of the CIV resonance pair. Designs of multiple VUV FPIs can be developed for integration into future orbiting solar observatories to obtain rapid cadence, spectral imaging of the transition region.},

Explanations for this enigma typically invoke the deposition in the corona of nonthermal energy generated by magnetoconvection. However, the coronal heating mechanism remains unknown. We used observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Hinode solar physics mission to reveal a ubiquitous coronal mass supply in which chromospheric plasma in fountainlike jets or spicules is accelerated upward into the corona, with much of the plasma heated to temperatures between \textasciitilde{}0.02 and 0.1 million kelvin (MK) and a small but sufficient fraction to temperatures above 1 MK. These observations provide constraints on the coronal heating mechanism(s) and highlight the importance of the interface region between photosphere and corona.},

  abstract = {An analytical model for the quiescent inhomogeneous solar corona is developed on the basis of the hypothesis that looplike structures are the basic coronal building blocks. By assuming that quiescent loop structures observed in X-rays are in hydrostatic equilibrium, it is demonstrated that such loops must have their temperature maximum located near their apex and that substantial nonradiative energy deposition must occur along most of their length. The calculations yield a unique relation among loop temperature, pressure, and size, which fits the X-ray observations of quiescent structures well and is consistent with the initial assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. The results suggest that the coronal loops visible in X-rays represent a relatively
steady-state equilibrium of the confined plasmas and that fluctuations in such quantities as the local heating rate can lead to dynamically unstable states in which the loop plasma does not attain a temperature sufficient for X-ray emission. A parameterization of various proposed coronal heating theories is also developed within the context of the analytical model.},

  abstract = {Numerical computations of stationary solar coronal loop atmospheres are used to extend earlier analytical work. Two classes of loops are examined, namely symmetric loops with a temperature maximum at the top but now having a length greater than the pressure scale height and loops which have a local temperature minimum at the top. For the first class, new scaling laws are found which relate the base pressure and loop length to the base heating, the heating deposition scale height, and the pressure scale height. It is found that loops for which the length is greater than about two to three times the pressure scale height do not have stable solutions unless they have a temperature minimum at the top. Computed models with a temperature inversion at the top are permitted in a wider range of heating deposition scale height values than are loops with a temperature maximum at the top. These results are discussed in relation to observations showing a dependence of prominence formation and stability on the state of evolution of magnetic structures, and a general scenario is suggested for the understanding of loop evolution from emergence in active regions through the large-scale structure phase to opening in coronal holes.},

  abstract = {The bulk of solar coronal radiative loss consists of soft X-ray emission 
from quasi-static loops at the cores of active regions. In order to
develop diagnostics for determining the heating mechanism of these loops
from observations by coronal imaging instruments, I have developed
analytical solutions for the temperature structure and scaling laws of
loop strands for a set of temperature- and pressure-dependent heating
functions that encompass heating concentrated at the footpoints, uniform
heating, and heating concentrated at the loop apex. Key results are that
the temperature profile depends only weakly on the heating
distribution\textemdash{}not sufficiently to be of significant diagnostic
value\textemdash{}and that the scaling laws survive for this wide range of
heating distributions, but with the constant of proportionality in the
Rosner-Tucker-Vaiana scaling law (P 0 L \textasciitilde{} T 3
max) depending on the specific heating function. Furthermore,
quasi-static solutions do not exist for an excessive concentration of
heating near the loop footpoints, a result in agreement with recent
numerical simulations. It is demonstrated that a generalization of the
results to a set of solutions for strands with a functionally prescribed
variable diameter leads to only relatively small correction factors in
the scaling laws and temperature profiles for constant diameter loop
strands. A quintet of leading theoretical coronal heating mechanisms is
shown to be captured by the formalism of this paper, and the differences
in thermal structure between them may be verified through observations.
Preliminary results from full numerical simulations demonstrate that,
despite the simplifying assumptions, the analytical solutions from this
paper are accurate and stable.},
